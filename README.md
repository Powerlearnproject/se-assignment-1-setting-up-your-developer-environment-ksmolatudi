   Setup documentation

   To be honest i have already had most of the Softwares recommended except for mysql, in 2023 i learned python and visual studio code through youtube which is how i came to install most of the softwares. Below are the steps taken

   Setting Up My Developer Environment

Step 1: Install the Operating System
I installed Windows 10 as my primary operating system.

Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code
I downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code which is my preferred code editor due to its versatility and the availability of numerous extensions.

Step 3: Install Git
I installed Git for version control. This allows me to track changes in my code and collaborate with other developers.

Step 4: Set Up Git
After installing Git, I set up my user name and email address which are used in the commit messages.
git config --global user.name "Katlego Molatudi"
git config --global user.email "ksmolatudi@gmail.com"

Step 5: Install Node.js and npm
I installed Node.js which also includes npm (node package manager). This allows me to run JavaScript code on my machine and manage project dependencies.

Step 6: Install Visual Studio Code Extensions
I installed several VS Code extensions that aid in development. Some of these include:
•	ESLint: This tool helps in identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
•	Prettier: An opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and reprinting it.

Step 7: Customize Visual Studio Code
I customized my VS Code settings to fit my coding style.
Troubleshooting Steps

During the setup, I encountered an issue where Git commands were not recognized in the VS Code terminal. I resolved this by adding Git to my system’s PATH in the Environment Variables settings.


7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
